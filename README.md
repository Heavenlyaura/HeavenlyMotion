# Overview

MovieBase is a movie database application built to strengthen my understanding of modern mobile development. This project focuses on consuming external APIs, managing state, handling user input, and designing a responsive UI using React Native.

The goal of building this application is to deepen my skills in mobile app development while working with real-world data and improving the overall user experience. By creating MovieBase, I am gaining hands-on experience with API integration, asynchronous JavaScript, and mobile UI/UX design principles using React Native and Appwrite as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS).
